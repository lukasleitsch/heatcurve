# WOLF Heating Curve Simulator

Visualize how a heating controller derives a flow setpoint temperature from the outdoor temperature. Enter your own values, simulate outdoor conditions, and immediately see how the flow temperature responds. The tool mirrors the heating curve simulation found on WOLF systems configured via the BM-2 module.
